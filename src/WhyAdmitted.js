                        With hundreds of thousands of students applying to university each year, the college application process is extremely competitive. 
                        As such, more and more college "counselors" and "gurus" claim that they know the secret to success. 
                        Yet, their services are both expensive and ineffective! 
                        Here at Admitted, our College Match Guarantee ensures a meeting and advice from a current or recent student of each school you're applying to. 
                        These students know what it takes to be accepted into their respective universities and they're ready to help you be admitted too!
