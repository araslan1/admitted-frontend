                            With hundreds of thousands of students applying to elite universities each year, the college application process is extremely competitive. As such, a growing number of college "counselors" and "gurus" are claiming that they know the secret to get into top colleges. Yet, their services are both expensive and not effective! Here at Admitted, our College Match Guarantee ensures that your application is being reviewed by current or recent students from each school you are applying to. These students know what it takes to be accepted into their respective universities and they're ready to help you be admitted too!
